# Gloomhaven-Monster-Tracker

A [web application](http://hiroshifuu.github.io/gloomhaven-monster-tracker) that track the monster health and status of Gloomhaven. This application helps to diminish the setup and action time involved with the physical game components per scenario, even more the health tracker board and status tag is so tiny!
